Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
# Made x equal to a string
x = "There are #{10} types of people."
# Made binary mean binary
binary = 'binary'
# turned do not into dont
do_not = "don't"
# Made y equal to a string
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."
Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
puts "I also said: '#{y}'." puts "I said: #{x}." joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."
Are you sure there's only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
You are adding those 2 strings together with the + sign
