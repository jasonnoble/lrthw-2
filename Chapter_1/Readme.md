Extra credit
1. Make your script print another line.
I added a line and it worked fine
2. Make your script print only one of the lines. 
By adding the # before the other lines of code it will prinnt the remaing lines without the #
3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
This changed the text string after it to a remark.
An 'octothorpe' is also called a 'pound', 'hash', 'mesh', or any number of names.
