Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Skill 2) Attention to detail: Pay attention to what you are doing. Type it right the first time.

Skill 3) Spotting differences: My ability to spot what is written and what I have typed. This will help to train my brain to see the differences right away.

Why do you need to not copy and paste?
